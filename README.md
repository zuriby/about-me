Bar Yochay’s entrepreneurial journey began with the founding of **Regulus Labs**, a network software company, prior to his main venture in cybersecurity ([Tzury Bar Yochay | Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/tzury-bar-yochay#:~:text=founded%20Reblaze%20to%20pioneer%20an,As%20a%20thought%20leader%20in)). In 2011, he co-founded **Reblaze Technologies** together with Eyal Hayardeny ([Link11 grows internationally: Reblaze Technologies becomes part of Link11 Group](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/press/link11-grows-internationally-reblaze-technologies-becomes-part-of-the-link11-group/#:~:text=Both%20cyber%20security%20pioneers%20share,machine%20learning%20and%20behavioral%20profiling)). Reblaze is a Tel Aviv-based company focused on web application and API protection (WAAP) delivered via a cloud platform. As Reblaze’s CTO, Bar Yochay has guided the company to **pioneer a new approach to cloud security**, leveraging cutting-edge techniques like machine learning and behavioral traffic profiling ([Link11 grows internationally: Reblaze Technologies becomes part of Link11 Group](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/press/link11-grows-internationally-reblaze-technologies-becomes-part-of-the-link11-group/#:~:text=Both%20cyber%20security%20pioneers%20share,machine%20learning%20and%20behavioral%20profiling)). The Reblaze platform is an all-in-one web security solution that includes a next-generation web application firewall (WAF), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) mitigation, bot management, API security, and other defenses for modern cloud architectures ([Link11 grows internationally: Reblaze Technologies becomes part of Link11 Group](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/press/link11-grows-internationally-reblaze-technologies-becomes-part-of-the-link11-group/#:~:text=Reblaze%20Technologies%E2%80%99%20all,Plattform%20%28WAAP)). Under his technical leadership, Reblaze grew internationally – serving Fortune 500 enterprises and customers worldwide – and established itself as a leading provider of cloud-native web security ([Link11 grows internationally: Reblaze Technologies becomes part of Link11 Group](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/press/link11-grows-internationally-reblaze-technologies-becomes-part-of-the-link11-group/#:~:text=Application%20Firewall%20,international%20IT%20security%20provider%20Link11)). This success culminated in January 2024, when Reblaze was **acquired by Link11**, a global IT security firm, as part of Link11’s expansion of its security cloud platform ([Link11 grows internationally: Reblaze Technologies becomes part of Link11 Group](https://www.link11.com/en/blog/press/link11-grows-internationally-reblaze-technologies-becomes-part-of-the-link11-group/#:~:text=Frankfurt%20am%20Main%2FTel%20Aviv%2C%20January,market%20strategy)).

- **Curiefense Open-Source Security (2020):** Bar Yochay is the co-creator of **Curiefense**, an open-source web application firewall and security platform for cloud-native environments ([Tzury Bar Yochay | Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/author/tzury-bar-yochay#:~:text=Tzury%20Bar%20Yochay)) ([The Kubelist Podcast | Ep. #13, Curiefense with Tzury Bar Yochay and Justin Dorfman of Reblaze | Heavybit](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-kubelist-podcast/ep-13-curiefense-with-tzury-bar-yochay-and-justin-dorfman-of-reblaze#:~:text=The%20beginning%20of%20last%20year%2C,to%20release%20as%20open%20source)). Curiefense was initially developed within Reblaze and released to the open-source community in 2020 as a comprehensive Envoy Proxy extension for web security ([The Kubelist Podcast | Ep. #13, Curiefense with Tzury Bar Yochay and Justin Dorfman of Reblaze | Heavybit](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-kubelist-podcast/ep-13-curiefense-with-tzury-bar-yochay-and-justin-dorfman-of-reblaze#:~:text=The%20beginning%20of%20last%20year%2C,to%20release%20as%20open%20source)). Bar Yochay championed this project to make advanced security tooling freely available; in fact, Curiefense was **donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as a sandbox project, ensuring it could grow under open governance and community contribution ([The Kubelist Podcast | Ep. #13, Curiefense with Tzury Bar Yochay and Justin Dorfman of Reblaze | Heavybit](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/the-kubelist-podcast/ep-13-curiefense-with-tzury-bar-yochay-and-justin-dorfman-of-reblaze#:~:text=So%20you%20have%20a%20commercial%2C,2012%2C%20working%20on%20this%20space)). This reflects his strong belief that collaborative open-source efforts are vital for keeping pace with evolving cyber threats.

- **jQuery Hotkeys Library (late 2000s):** Earlier in his career, Tzury Bar Yochay created the original *jQuery Hotkeys* plugin – a lightweight JavaScript library that lets developers bind keyboard shortcuts to web page elements with ease ([Jquery.hotkeys - Free Software Directory](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Jquery.hotkeys#:~:text=keyboard%20events%20anywhere%20in%20your,supporting%20almost%20any%20key%20combination)). This plugin gained popularity among web developers and was later used as the basis for official jQuery hotkey implementations ([Jquery.hotkeys - Free Software Directory](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Jquery.hotkeys#:~:text=keyboard%20events%20anywhere%20in%20your,supporting%20almost%20any%20key%20combination)).
